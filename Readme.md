# Infinite Dungeon Crawler

This is a dungeon crawler game where the map is infinite, the original map is replicated in all directions. For example, if you north until you reach the end of the map, you will be teleported to the south of the map, and vice versa. The same applies to the east and west directions. This project is based in the book Rust Hands-On by Claus Matzinger.
